# The Fault in Our Github
A living record of all the times Github experiences outages, along with people's reactions.

## Purpose
It's so awesome that Github is the premier online platform for Open Source projects and social coding. Github even [reported](https://octoverse.github.com) that millions of people actively use the platform. So it would be devastating to see its services become unavailable for any noticeable amount of time. Being an active user myself, a recent outage affected one of my team's work.

Now I'm here to document the lived experiences of those affected by service disruptions to show just how important Github is to the world.

## Before I Joined
* A [week](https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/github-goes-down-with-major-disruption/) of DDoS attacks in October 2012.
* A major DDoS that might have been [backed by China's government](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/ddos-attacks-that-crippled-github-linked-to-great-firewall-of-china/).
 
## After I Joined
* Today, [July 31st 2017](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/github-goes-down-takes-developer-102238200.html), Github experienced a major outage for an hour. See screenshot.
 
## #Goals
* Pull a complete site history form Github's [status API](https://status.github.com/api/daily-summary.json)
* Find the logs where major incidents was greater than zero
* Use [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets) to find relevant tweets on those days
* Visualize the information. (Graph? Timeline?)
* Deploy as a Github Pages site
