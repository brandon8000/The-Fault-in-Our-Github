# The Fault in Our Github
A record of all the times Github experiences outages, along with people's reactions.

## Before I Joined
 * A [week](https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/github-goes-down-with-major-disruption/) of DDoS attacks in October 2012.
 * A major DDoS that might have been [backed by China's government](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/ddos-attacks-that-crippled-github-linked-to-great-firewall-of-china/).
 
 ## After I Joined
 These incidents will have their own folders.
 
 Note: Today, [July 31st 2017](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/github-goes-down-takes-developer-102238200.html), Github experienced a major outage for an hour. See screenshot.
 
 ## Goals
 Write a script that monitors Github's status using their API and send notifications when it experiences major outages. Deploy it on Github Pages so that it can be working live, 24/7.
